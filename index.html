      <h1>About Me:</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I am a highschool student who enjoys programming and plans to pursue engineering in 
        College. My favorite thing to do in life is play hockey. Whether it be ice hockey, roller 
        hockey, or watching hockey (Even though I'm a Jackets Fan), hockey is a big piece of who 
        I am. I also enjoy all kinds of racing. I watch F1 religiously, watch the entire Tour de 
        France every year, go to local dirt track racing, and still find time to watch Indycar, 
        Nascar, and many other series. I have even begun my own racing career as I have begun 
        Autocross. Now I am more than just hockey and racing but if I included everything about 
        me then this section would be 10 pages.
      </p>

      <h1>About the Website:</h1>
      <p>
        This website is divided into 4 sections. Like many, I have a <a href="projects.html">
        Projects Section</a> to house all of my programming projects I've created. From browser games,         
        picture of who I am. The second section is a <a href="blogs.html">Blog</a> where I usually just
        ramble on about something going on at my school. To be honest, I rarely write blogs anymore, 
        but they can still be fun to read. The third section of my website is a <a href="misc.html">
        Miscellaneous</a> section. There's really no theme to this section as it is things I've done
        that just don't fit anywhere else. Some examples of the misc section include my Autocross results
        and CAD creations. Finally, the final section is a <a href="history.html">History</a> timeline 
        type thing. This section gives a really good picture of how I've progressed as a programmer and
        as a person in general. The history section has everything semi-important thing from my life that
        I can think of and ties everything I've ever done into one page. Feel free to check out any/all 
        sections.

      <p id="jsExp">
        Javascript was my first ever programming language. I learned basic JS in a summer camp
        when I was 12 years old. Javascript has always been my main language and therefore is my
        strongest. From supporting basic HTML functions to being the backbone of my projects, my 
        knowledge of JS has grown throughout the years. Overtime, JS has become the core of my 
        programming identity and is my go to answer to the programming debate of "What is the 
        best language?"
      </p>
      <p id="htmlExp">
        HTML was the second "Programming Language" I ever learned. Yes I know it's not really a 
        programming language but too bad. Anyways, I used HTML primarily throughout middle school 
        to make websites for my presentations to achieve the "Above and Beyond" points for making 
        a presentation on something other than Google Slides. Those early websites had very 
        little styling to them but the created the foundation for my later projects. Nowadays, all 
        my projects use HTML to be on the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p id="cssExp">
        Learning CSS was a natural progression from learning HTML. CSS is a styling language that 
        allows HTML to be more than just a boring text document. I'm still not great at CSS (I still
        struggle with centering a div &#x1F605;) but I have improved a lot over the years and don't have to 
        rely on the internet as much as I used to. With that being said, If there was one place where
        I find myself using AI, it would be CSS. Either way, my CSS skills come and go depending on the 
        project.
      </p>
      <p id="javaExp">
        Out of all the true programming languages that I have experience with, Java is the one I have 
        the second most confidence in. I learned Java in my sophomore year of HS in AP CSA and continued 
        to use it in IB CS as a Junior. The only real project I have used Java for is my 
        <a href="projects/Backgammon/">Backgammon</a> Game. I can only really create basic projects 
        using Java, but because it's very similar to my main language, JS, I have a good understanding 
        of it and can understand more complex programs.
      </p>
      <p id="pythonExp">
        Python is definitely my worst programming language. The only experience I have with it is through 
        daily/weekly coding assignments in IB CS, and through making UNO in Python. There's not really 
        much more to be said about my Python skills other than that I know the basics. 
      </p>
      <p id="sheetsExp">
        Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program that I often use to process data. I learned how to use it
        in middle school when I was doing <a href="projects/hockeyStats/">Stats</a> for my hockey team. 
        I've used these skills throughout my high school career, in my computer science, math, and science 
        classes, but also for fun. Whenever me and my friends would play games like wiffleball or street 
        hockey, we would make a league and I was always tasked with keeping track of the stats. I encourage
        everyone to learn how to use a spreadsheet program, as it is a very useful skill to have.
      </p>
      <p id="freecadExp">
        FreeCAD is an open source CAD program that I learned how to use in 8th grade. Because my dad has a 
        3d printer, I can often make anything I want, as long as I am able to design it first. I sparsely 
        use FreeCAD, and because of this, I often forget how to do things. Regardless, I have made a few 
        cool 3D models that you can find on my
