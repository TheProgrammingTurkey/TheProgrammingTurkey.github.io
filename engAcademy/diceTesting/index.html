    <h1>Quality Control Lab</h1>

    <h2>Testing Dice</h2>

    <p class="date">9/2/25</p>

      For this lab we were tasked with testing the fairness of multiple sets of dice from 
      the company Black Oak Workshop. To do this we rolled each die 10 times per side (40 
      times for the d4) and recorded the results in a spreadsheet. Then we used histograms, 
      bar graphs, and a Chi-Squared test to analyze the results. Overall, the dice were fairly
      balanced, with only the d20 and d10(0) being unfair. That said, with a smaller sample 
      size it may be possible that the dice are actually fair, and just appeared unfair due to
      random chance. You can click the link to view the full lab report.
