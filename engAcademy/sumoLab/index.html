      For the Sumo Robot Lab, we were tasked with building a robot that could push 
      all the other robots out of a circle. To do this we were given all of the usual 
      pieces, 3 motors, and this time we were allowed to control our robots from our 
      phones. After initially trying a high torque, low speed design, we decided to 
      make a fast and agile robot that could quickly get behind other robots and push 
      them out of the circle. We ended up winning our first match, against the eventual
      champions, and the second match before losing the final 3. Click the link below to 
      see our lab report.
