    <h1>Mass Launcher Lab</h1>

    <h2>Building a LEGO Catapult</h2>

    <p class="date">8/25/25</p>

    <p>
      Tasked with launching a ball as far as possible using LEGO, me and two other group 
      members decided to build a catapult. We used rubber bands to store potential energy, 
      and attached them to the bottom part of the catapult arm and the base. This provided 
      enough energy to launch the ball 21 feet, with a launch velocity of around 18.4 mph.
      My role in the team was to continuously strengthen the structure of the catapult to 
      prevent it from breaking as we added more rubber bands. Overall it was a fun first 
      project to the year. You can click the link to view the full lab report.
