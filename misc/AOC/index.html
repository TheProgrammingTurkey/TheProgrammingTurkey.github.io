    <h1>Advent Of Code</h1>

    <h2>A Yearly Coding Advent Calendar</h2>

    <p class="date">Begun on 12/25/22</p>

    <p>
      Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming 
      puzzles split in 2 parts, every day, for the 25 days before 
      Christmas. Any programming language is allowed, and I absolutely 
      recommend trying this yearly challenge as it definitely improves 
      problem-solving and programming abilities.
    </p>

      In 2022, my first year, I attempted the challenge in Javascript. 
      With it being my first year, I definitely struggled and only completed
      5 of the first 6 days (1-4 and 6). One problem I ran into was that as
      the days took longer and longer to complete, I got closer and closer to
      finals week. With finals week looming, I would lose motivation to complete
      each day and instead would study for finals. In general, however, I was
      still fairly new to programming and just didn't know how complete the days.

      2023 was my second year attempting the challenge. I decided to try it in Java
      as I was in AP Computer Science A at the time, which was a Java class. With it
      being a new language, I struggled similarly to the first year. However, with a
      a year passing, I did have more experience and was able to figure out better
      approaches to the problems. In 2023 I managed to complete the first 4 days, as
      well as days 6, 7, and 8. Overall, seeing some improvement is the important thing.

      In 2024, I really wanted to go as far as I could. With this goal in mind, I chose
      my best programming language, Javascript, and set aside time each day to make sure
      I didn't fall behind. Due to these measures, I saw a huge improvement. I was managing
      to complete some of the early days in under an hour and went as far as I ever had before.
      In the end, I managed to complete the first 10 days, and got halfway through days 11 and 12.
      I am really happy on how I did this year, and I hope I can make it into the teens next year.
