      Coming off a finally finished pong game, one that took me almost 5 months to finish, I was ready 
      to make an easier game, hopefully only taking a couple of days. Although it took a little longer, 
      around a week or so in my rising sophomore summer, It was nice to finish a game with little bugs.
      The gameplay is very simple, there are 4 arrows and when one shows, just press the corresponding 
      arrow on your keyboard. Be careful because mistakes cost time! Get 30 arrows in the quickest possible 
      time, and compete with your friends using the leaderboard.
