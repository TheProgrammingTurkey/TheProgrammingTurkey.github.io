      A Stars Life was a choose your own adventure game that I made in the 2nd
      semester of my 8th grade year. It was made for a physical science project
      that I said you know what, why not code it. On the website you go through
      different stages of a star. It is randomized meaning sometimes you could
      end up as a black hole, a planetary nebula, or not even make it to
      becoming a star. To play, just click the button below and
      learn about stars.
