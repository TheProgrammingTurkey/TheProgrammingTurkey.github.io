    <h1>DNA Slicer</h1>

    <h2>Cut Up Dna With Restriction Enzymes</h2>

      DNA Slicer was program that I wrote during my 2nd semester of 
      my freshmen year in highschool. When given a string of DNA and a 
      restriction enzyme's restriction site, it can cut the DNA up 
      into fragments. It is basically an online method equivalent of 
      inserting a restriction enzyme into DNA and putting it in a 
      gel electrophoresis apparatus to measure the length of DNA 
      fragments. This technique can even be used to match DNA of 
      different people to solve crimes. I made a console based, 
      and web based version of this, and if you would like to check 
      either out you can click the links below.
