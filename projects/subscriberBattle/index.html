    <h1>Subscriber Battle</h1>

    <h2>Youtube Statistic Tracker Between 2 Channels</h2>

    <p class="date">3/7/25</p>

    <p>
      Two of my friends have been in a little youtube subscriber battle for a little while,
      and I thought it would be fun to make a website to track both of their websites. Instead
      of going to each of their channels every time they wanted to check, they could just go to
      this website and see the current subscriber count of both of them. It also shows their views
      and views per video. There's really nothing else to it, but it was a fun little project to 
      make. Anyone wishing to make something similar can always fork my repository and change the
      channel ids to their own.
