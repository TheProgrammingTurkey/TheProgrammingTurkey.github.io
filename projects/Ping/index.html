    <h2>Top Down Ping Pong Game</h2>

      Ping was my take on the classic "Pong" game made by Atari. Because it was my first JS canvas project, 
      it took a lot of learning and getting used to. This caused it to take a longer time to make than I thought, 
      taking just about five months during the second semester of my freshman year of highschool. I modified 
      the original game by adding powerups and making the paddles close in towards each other. With three different 
      gamemodes and three difficulties, Ping is worth a try. Click the link below to check it out.
