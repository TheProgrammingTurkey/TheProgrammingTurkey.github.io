      When I was in 6th or 7th grade my class was doing a game where you would have to name something that fits in 
      the given category without stalling or repeating something. The category was video games and as one of my 
      friends was drawing a blank he blurted out: Soap Dispenser Simulator. The idea became a running joke for a 
      couple of years, and as I got better at making games with JS Canvas I realized that it would be the perfect 
      game to make. Multiple dispensers at the top of the screen dispense soap drops and it's your job to catch 
      them to score points. Now with the game done, I can prove that my friend actually named a real game.
