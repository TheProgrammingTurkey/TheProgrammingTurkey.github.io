    <h1>Backgammon</h1>

    <h2>Java Recreation of the Backgammon Board Game</h2>

    <p class="date">3/19/24</p>

    <p>
      I recreated the classic board game Backgammon for a computer science project. In my sophomore year in 
      highschool, I took AP Computer Science A. It was a really cool class and the biggest thing I learned in it 
      was how to code in Java. Towards the end of year we were assigned a board game project, where we had to recreate 
      a classic board game using Java Processing. I chose Backgammon, and it was a really nice to use everything I 
      had learned over the school year to create a game that I could play. Although not runnable in the web, click the 
      link below to check out the code.
