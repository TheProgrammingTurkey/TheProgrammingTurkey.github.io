    <h1>Gravity Chess</h1>

    <h2>Vanilla Chess But With Gravity And Platforms</h2>

    <p>
      Gravity Chess is like any other standard chess game, except for one aspect: gravity. After every turn
      the pieces fall down to the bottom of the board, stacking on top of each other. Also, to improve the gameplay,
      users can place and move platforms on the board, where pieces can land on. This allows for some interesting 
      gameplay and strategies. I made this project over my summer vacation of 2025. I got the idea from the Tiktok 
      user "@viper_chess" who made a video theorizing how a chess game with gravity would work. With my vacation 
      looming, the fact that I've never made a chess game, and the fact that I wanted to make a project in Python,
      I decided to make it a real game to test his theory. In the end, the game works for the most part, just the
      end game is a little dull. I believe this version of chess is worth a try, so feel free to check it out.
