    <h1>Reverse Flappy Bird</h1>

    <h2>GMTK 2023 - "Roles Reversed"</h2>

    <p class="date">7/25/23</p>

    <p>
        Reverse Flappy Bird was my submission for the 48-hour GMTK 2023 challenge with the theme "Roles Reversed". 
        Now I say it was my submission, but I kind of missed the event and forgot about it until a week after, seeing 
        other people's creations. I still made it within the time limit so I'm gonna say it counts but unfortunately 
        I can't submit it at all. Anyways, the way the game works is the bird is AI controlled, and it's your job to 
        guide it past all the pipes using the arrow keys moving the bird up and down. Other than that it's the classic 
        game you know and love.
