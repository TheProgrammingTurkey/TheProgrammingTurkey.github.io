    <p>
      FTH Stats 2.0 is an upgrade on my first ever project, FTH Stats, and was
      made for my Internal Assessment for IB Computer Science. Because of this,
      it is not done. I just needed a complete version to submit for class. I 
      made it over the second semester of my junior year of high school. It was
      supposed to have two parts, a heatmap for shots and a specialized goalie 
      stats taker, but once I submitted what I had to IB, I immediately lost 
      motivation and never gave the project another thought. Either way, feel free 
      to check it out.
