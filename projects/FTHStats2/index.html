      FTH Stats 2.0 is an upgrade on my first ever project, FTH Stats, and was
      made for my Internal Assessment for IB Computer Science. Because of this,
      it is not yet done, and I plan to finish it soon. I just needed a complete
      version to submit for class. I made it over the second semester of my junior
      year of high school. Right now it only has one part, a heatmap for shots and
      goals. In the future, I plan to add more features like individual player stats,
      goalie stats, and much more. In the meantime, feel free to check it out.
