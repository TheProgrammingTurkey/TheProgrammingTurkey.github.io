    <h1>Hockey Havoc</h1>

    <h2>A Simple Top Down Hockey Game</h2>

    <p class="date">2/10/25</p>

    <p>
      Hockey Havoc is the final JS Canvas game I will ever make. I felt that every game I created should be 
      better than the last. This, however, only worked to a certain point. These games have been taking longer 
      and longer to complete, and I don't want to try to better this game. Either way, Hockey Havoc is a simple,
      keyboard only hockey game, with a season mode and quick play option. The game is played in a top down view,
      multiple difficulties for both modes. I must warn you that the game has a steep learning curve and should
      be played on the easiest difficulty first. Try not to lose 17-1 like I did on my first try.
