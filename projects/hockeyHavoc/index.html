    <h1>Hockey Havoc</h1>

    <h2>A Simple Top Down Hockey Game</h2>

    <p class="date">2/10/25</p>

    <p>
      Hockey Havoc is the final JS Canvas game I will ever make. I felt that every game I created should be 
      better than the last. This, however, only worked to a certain point. These games have been taking longer 
      and longer to complete, and I don't want to try to better this game. Either way, Hockey Havoc is a simple,
      keyboard only hockey game, with a season mode and quick play option. Right now the AI is very good and 
      practically has aimbot, but is very easy to score on if you learn how to beat it. In the future I plan to 
      fix the AI to make it more balanced. In the meantime, feel free to give it a try. Just try not to lose 37-1.
