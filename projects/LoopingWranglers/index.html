    <h1>Looping Wranglers</h1>

    <h2>GTMK 2025: Loop</h2>

    <p class="date">8/3/25</p>

    <p>
      Looping Wranglers was my submission for the 2025 Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam.
      The theme was "Loop," so I created a western themed game with a lasso to fit 
      the theme. Being my first every game jam I've completed, I'm just happy that 
      I was able to successfully submit a full complete game in time. In a nutshell,
      the game works with you controlling the cowboy, can you have to spin around in
      a circle and throw your lasso to wrangle all of your cattle back to their pen.
      The game is quite simple and straightforward but still fairly fun. Give it a try,
      but remember it was made in roughly 10 hours.
